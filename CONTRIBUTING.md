## Pull Request Process

This NPM package is published by [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/). In order to make it work you need to follow [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format when writing your commit messages. To make this process easier you can use interactive CLI tool [commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/).

### Commitizen

Install commitizen:

```
npm install -g commitizen
```

Commit your changes with commitizen. Instead of running `git commit` start committizen:

```
cz
```
